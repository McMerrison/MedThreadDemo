Perineal talc use has been suggested as a possible risk
factor for ovarian cancer based on its structural si
asbestos, a known human carcinogen. A population-based
epidemiologic case-control study of epithelial ovarian cancer
(EOC) was conducted in 22 counties of Central California
that comprise the reporting area for 2 regional cancer reg-
istries. Telephone interviews were conducted with 256 cases
diagnosed in the years 2000-2001 and 1,122 controls fre-
quency-matched on age and ethnicity. The interview ob-
tained information on demographic factors, menstrual and
reproductive experience, exogenous hormone use, surgical
history and family history of cancer. Questions on perineal
talc use included frequency of use, duration of use and spe-
cific years when talc was used. Multivariate-adjusted odds
ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were derived
from unconditional logistic regression. The OR for ever use
of talc was 1.37 (Cl = 1.02-1.85) compared to never users.
However, no dose response association was found. Tubal
ligation (TL) modified the effect of talc on EOC such that
women with TL had an OR of 0.88 (Cl = 0.46-1.68) associ-
ated with perineal talc use, whereas women with no TL had
an OR of 1.54 (CI = 1.10-2.16). Talc use and EOC risk was
highest in women serous invasive tumors (OR = 1.77;
Cl = 1.12-2.81). This study provides some support for the
hypothesis that perineal talc use is associated with an in-
creased risk of EOC.

Interest in the relationship between talcum powder and ovarian
cancer risk is based on certain physical properties of talcum
powder, including the fact that talc is mineralogically similar to
asbestos and that talcum powder manufactured before 1973 may
have been contaminated with asbestos.! In animal studies, talc and
other similar substances have been demonstrated to migrate from
the vagina through the peritoneal cavity to the ovaries.2 Henderson
et al.3 also observed that particles with the appearance of talc were
more prevalent in ovarian tumors than in normal ovarian tissue.
Several epidemiologic studies have investigated perineal use of
talcum powder as a potential risk factor for ovarian cancer and
most have found elevations in risk, although there has been a large
range in the risk estimates, from 1.1 to 3.9.4 Collectively, these
studies point to a possible etiologic role of talc in ovarian cancer
via an inflammatory process at the site of the ovarian epithelium,>
although recall bias may play a role in retrospective studies.+
Inflammation produces oxidants that are thought to damage DNA
and Ames et al.® argue that damage to tumor suppressor genes
caused by the inflammatory process leads to carcinogenesis.
Chronic inflammation may also result in deregulated cytokine
production, which may result in altered cell growth, inhibition of
apoptosis and changes in differentiation.”

Cramer et al.8 proposed 2 mechanisms that might explain talc
carcinogenesis. Talc may stimulate the entrapment of the ovarian
surface epithelium, thus mimicking what occurs during ovulation
and posing a risk similar to that proposed by incessant ovulation.?
Alternatively, if talc is present at the time of ovulation, it may
become incorporated into the inclusion cyst. It has been suggested
that foreign-body exposure may result in granulomas'® and that

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ijc.20434

pure talc may induce granulomas in open wounds.'! Granulomas
are also associated with persistent acute inflammatory responses.'2

The role of cornstarch powder on ovarian cancer risk has also
been evaluated in epidemiologic research and a recent review
concluded that there is no association between this type of powder
and increased risk of ovarian cancer.'3 The conclusion was based
on a total of 4 case-control studies that elicited information on use
of cornstarch in perineal dusting, in which the average odds ratio
was 0.62. However, there were only a total of 20 cases of ovarian
cancer combined in those studies and 51 control subjects. Corn-
starch is also not thought to exert the same toxicologic reaction in
human tissue as does talc.!3

MATERIAL AND METHODS

A population-based epidemiologic case-control study of epithe-
lial ovarian cancer (EOC) was conducted in 22 counties of Central
California that comprise the reporting area for 2 regional cancer
registries. Geographically, these counties make up the majority of
the Central Valley of California, which is the poorest area of the
state, with many residents living below the poverty level.!* De-
mographically, the Valley is a very ethnically diverse area in
which many counties are over 40% Hispanic. Two population-
based cancer registries have monitored cancer incidence in the
Central Valley of California continuously since 1988: the Cancer
Registry of Central California (CRCC) in Fresno and the Cancer
Surveillance Program (CSP), Region 3, in Sacramento.!>!6 All
newly diagnosed histologically confirmed EOC patients were
available for inclusion in this study for the years 2000 and 2001.

Cases were women-identified via a rapid case ascertainment
(RCA) procedure as having been diagnosed with EOC (malignant
neoplasms of the ovary, ICD-O 3 = C56.9) living in the Central
Valley during a 24-month period from 1 January 2000 through 31
December 2001. Tumors were designated as borderline if the
behavior code was designated as 1, or if the pathology report
described the tumor as borderline, low malignant potential, or
atypically proliferating.!? The borderline classification was limited
to serous and mucinous cell types because ICD-O 3 has no mor-
phology code for the borderline classification in the other subtypes
and because serous and mucinous tumors make up the majority of
borderline tumors.'* All other tumors were classified as invasive.

Histologic subtypes were identified by pathologic report or by
ICD-O 3 morphology codes. The histologic subtypes included
were serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell and other epithe-
lial/unclassified. The latter category included unspecified adeno-
carcinomas as well as undifferentiated tumors in which a cell type
could not be classified histologically. All newly diagnosed EOCs
of epithelial origin were identified via RCA methods in which
hospital tumor registrars were asked to provide listings of newly
diagnosed EOCs within 1 month of diagnosis. A board-certified
pathologist reviewed the pathology reports of a sample of cases.
Physician consent was obtained by mailing the physician of record
a letter and informing him/her that an interview with the patient
was planned. If the physician did not respond within a 3-week
period, passive consent was assumed. The control group consisted
of women 18 years or older selected by random digit dialing
(RDD) techniques who were residents of the area, had not been
diagnosed with EOC and had at least one intact ovary at the time
of the interview. Controls were frequency matched to cases on age
and race/ethnicity. The overall data collection period covered a
2-year period, with each respondent being interviewed only once
during this period by telephone. Interviews were conducted with
both cases and controls on a monthly basis throughout the 2-year
period.

All cases and controls were approached via an introductory
letter that included a prompt list that described topics the interview
questions would address. The Institutional Review Board at the
Public Health Institute approved the study protocol. For both case
and control groups, letters and prompt lists were sent in either
English or Spanish on the letterhead of the principal investigator.
Telephone interviews with both case and control respondents were
conducted by female professional, trained telephone interviewers
in either English or Spanish as preferred by the respondent.

The interview obtained information on demographic factors as
well as information pertinent to the respondent’s menstrual and
reproductive experience, use of exogenous hormones, gynecologic
surgical history and family history of cancer. Four questions were
asked in regard to the use of talcum powder, including adult use in
the genital area, calendar year(s) of use, frequency of use (i.e.,
daily, several times a week) and total duration of use. The last 2
questions were used to create a variable reflecting—cumulative
use by combining frequency (categorically weighted 0-3) and
duration (in months) of use.

Age-adjusted odds ratios were calculated using the Mantel-
Haenszel method.! Multivariate adjusted odds ratios were calcu-
lated using unconditional logistic regression.” Initially, multivar-
iate models were constructed to include age as a continuous
variable and race/ethnicity, duration of use of oral contraceptives,
duration of breast-feeding, history of breast or EOC in a first-
degree relative, pregnancy history, parity, body mass index (BMI),
hysterectomy, tubal ligation and duration of hormone replacement
therapy use as categorical variables. However, the Hosmer-Lem-
show goodness-of-fit tests revealed that after terms for duration of
oral contraceptive use and duration of breast-feeding were added
to the models, fit was not improved by the addition of the other
variables listed above. Nor were the estimated odds ratios altered
by the addition of the several variables listed above. Therefore, in
the interest of parsimony, the final models chosen for the analysis
included terms for age, race/ethnicity, oral contraceptive use and
breast-feeding. Interaction was assessed by comparing stratum-
specific odds ratios. If the stratum-specific odds ratios differed by
more than 100%, interaction was also assessed by including first-
order cross product terms into the logistic model and examining
the significance of the interaction coefficient. Tests for trend were
conducted for variables that were ordinal in nature by recoding the
categories into continuous form and evaluating the Wald statistic
associated with the resulting coefficient. Confounding was as-
sessed by examining the differences in the crude, age-adjusted and
multivariate-adjusted odds ratios.

RESULTS

The regional cancer registries initially identified a total of 652
cases of confirmed epithelial ovarian cases residing in the 22
county study area diagnosed between 1 January 2000 and 31
December 2001. Seventeen cases were excluded due to speaking a
language other than English or Spanish or due to hearing/speech
impairment, resulting in 635 cases that met the study criteria.
Seventy-six cases died prior to research contact and physicians
refused permission to contact for 10 cases. Forty-one cases were
too ill to participate in the study and 119 were not contacted due
to incorrect telephone numbers or no answer after repeated efforts.
Of the remaining 389 cases, 133 refused to participate, resulting in
256 completed interviews. Therefore, the response fraction was
40% among all cases identified. There were no significant differ-
ences in age (p = 0.273) or level of invasiveness between inter-
viewed and noninterviewed cases. Histologically, interviewed
cases were more likely to be of the serous subtype (57.4% for
interviewed cases, 45.6% for noninterviewed cases) and less likely
to be classified as “other epithelial” (10.5% for interviewed cases;
22% for noninterviewed cases). There was no statistically signif-
icant difference between interviewed and noninterviewed cases for
the other histologic subtypes. Information on perineal talc use was
missing in 7 cases.

Households with eligible women were identified through RDD
methods, resulting in 2,327 controls identified and sent an intro-
ductory letter with a prompt list. Eighty of these women were later
found not to meet the age requirement and 21 were ineligible due
to residence outside the study area. Ten controls were excluded
due to speaking a language other than English or Spanish. Two
hundred fifty-two controls were excluded due to reporting bilateral
oophorectomy, resulting in 1,964 controls that met the study
criteria. Nineteen controls were too ill to participate and 358 were
later found to have moved, changed phone numbers, or failed to
answer after repeated efforts. Of the remaining 1,587 contacted
controls, 465 refused to participate, resulting in 1,122 completed
control interviews for a response fraction of 57% for total identi-
fied eligible controls. Information on perineal talc exposure was
missing in 17 controls.

Invasive tumors constituted 71.1% of the case series and 28.9% of
the tumors were of borderline malignancy. Among non-Hispanic
white women, who constituted 74% of the cases, 25.8% were of
borderline invasiveness. Overall, 57% of the case series were serous
adenocarcinomas, divided 60% and 40% for invasive and borderline,
respectively. Mucinous and endometrioid each comprised 14% of the
EOC cases. There were slightly more mucinous borderline cases than
invasive cases. Clear cell and other/unclassified histologies made up
the remaining 5% and 11%, respectively.

The demographic characteristics of all cases and controls and
cases and controls stratified by talc exposure are shown in Table I.
Matching was successful and cases and controls were similar in
age and ethnicity. Controls were less likely to have finished high
school but more likely to have an education beyond high school. A
somewhat larger proportion of the case series were single (12.5%)
compared to the control series (10.0%). Control women were more
likely to have been born outside of the United States (16.8%) than
were cases (12.9%).

A total of 42.6% of EOC cases reported ever use of talcum powder
in the perineal area while 37.1% of control women reported such a
history. Case women using tale were slightly older at interview than
controls. Women in the oldest age group used talc less than younger
women, much more so for control women than case women. White
non-Hispanic women were more likely to use talc than their Hispanic
counterparts. Talc use was higher in both white non-Hispanic and
Hispanic cases compared to controls but this pattern was not seen in
the “other” ethnic category. Talc use was also associated with a higher
education level. Talc use was higher in both cases and controls with
birthplace in the United States.

Ever use of talcum powder in the genital area was associated
with a 37% elevation in risk of EOC, which was statistically
significant (Table II). Increasing frequency of use was associated
with increasing risk such that those women who reported use 4-7
times per week experienced a significant 74% elevation in EOC
risk (p for trend = 0.015). However, this was not a monotonic
trend in that risk decreased between the second and third catego-
ries of use (from 1.34 to 1.16). Duration of use of talcum powder
was associated with increased risk, although the pattern was also
not clear-cut in that the point estimate peaked among those report-
ing 4-12 years of use and declined somewhat among those report-

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ijc.20434

ing longer duration of use (p for trend = 0.045). Cumulative use
also demonstrated an uneven association with risk of EOC in that
the point estimates peaked in the second and third quartiles of
intensity but declined in the highest quartile of use.

The multivariate adjusted odds ratios were elevated primarily
among those with a serous or mucinous invasive tumor and were
lower among women with other cell types or with borderline tumors
(Table II).

der after 1975 compared to those reporting use prior to that date
(Table IV). Higher risk was found among those reporting first use
at ages after age 20 compared to those who were younger at first
use (Table IV). In addition, risk was elevated among those women
who used talcum powder only after the birth of their first child,
while no effect was seen among those whose first use occurred
before their first child was born.

In an attempt to assess latency issues, we evaluated risk of EOC
by categorizing participants by the numbers of years since last
reported use of talcum powder (Table IV). The highest and sig-
nificant risks were found among women who had stopped using

An evaluation of effect modification of the talcum powder-EOC
relationship by gynecologic surgery, reproductive history, exoge-

without a tubal ligation experienced higher talcum powder-asso-

ification within categories of prior hysterectomy, however. Higher
risks were observed among those who were ever pregnant com-
pared to those who were never pregnant. Talcum powder-associ-
ated risk was not different within the parous and nulliparous.
Talcum powder-associated risk was higher (and significant) in
women who never used oral contraceptives; however, the interac-
tion coefficient was not statistically significant. Neither BMI or
hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use appeared to modify the
relationship of talc use and EOC risk.

DISCUSSION

The prevalence of talc use among controls in our study (37.1%) is
similar to the average percentage of use among the control popula-
tions in a review of 14 studies (36.8% calculated from data presented
in original study).?! In the current analysis as in others,!!2!-*4 a larger
percentage of cases versus controls reported perineal exposure to talc.
We found a slight trend of decreasing use with increasing age in
control women but our findings were not as strong as those noted by
Rosenblatt et al.?> Other studies?! have found increased use in both
cases and controls over 50 years of age compared to their counterparts

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ijc.20434

less than or equal to 50 years of age. In the present study, cases less
than 50 years of age were more likely to have used talc versus women
50 years or older (47.7% and 39.9%, respectively). Different findings
in tale use pattems between the present study and previous studies
may be explained by differences in study locations, study time periods
and age categories. Frequency of use in the current study was similar
for both the younger and older groups in controls (38.2% and 36.4%,
respectively),

Talc use was higher in white non-Hispanics compared to His-
panics in this study. However, the pattern of increased use in EOC
cases for both groups contributed to the overall increased risk of
EOC among talc users. Differential talc use by various ethnic
groups and its relation to EOC risk has not, to our knowledge, been
evaluated previously.

As in other studies,?"-*5 we found that talc use increased with
education level, although one earlier study reported the opposite
finding.* Other studies have compared talc use in ever married to
never married women and found either similar use in both groups for
cases and controls?! or increased frequency of use in ever married
women.”* In the current analysis, talc exposure was 43.8% for ever
married cases versus 34.4% for never married cases. However, fre-

quency of use was similar between ever married and never married
controls (37.2% and 36.0%, respectively). There was much greater
use of tale among those born in the United States versus those born
outside it.

The odds ratio comparing ever use to never use in this study
(OR = 1.37; CI = 1.02-1.85) is similar to the results of a recent
metaanalysis that pooled 16 studies (summary RR = 1.33; CI =
1.16-1.45).4 When stratified by hospital- versus population-based
studies, the population studies had a summary relative risk of 1.38
(1.25-1.52).

Cornstarch use and ovarian cancer has been evaluated in a small
number of case-control studies!!?!2.26 and have been reviewed.
with the conclusion that no relationship exists between cornstarch
and EOC, although the number of study participants using corn-
starch versus talc was small.'3 Our study was not able to differ-
entiate between use of perineal powders containing talc and those
containing cornstarch, which may have driven the odds ratio
toward the null. Type of application, including direct application
on the perineum, or indirect exposure from dusting sanitary nap-
kins, underwear and diaphragms (storage) was also not assessed.

As in other studies,* the present study did not find a clear dose
response based on duration of use or cumulative use. Limiting the
analysis of dose response to women who reported ever use of talc
did not affect the results (data not shown). The lack of dose
response between talc use and EOC may be explained by the
inability to quantify the actual amount of talc used per application
and timing of the application.?2! Cramer et al.?! propose that
application during ovulation may pose more risk due to the pos-
sibility of talc entrapment in inclusion cysts. Harlow et al.?4 found
little change in odds ratios after excluding use after tubal ligation
or hysterectomy in their estimate of total lifetime perineal talc
applications. However, when they excluded nonovulatory periods
of exposure in their calculation, there was significant increase in
risk. We were unable to exclude nonovulatory periods and talcum.
powder use after gynecologic surgery in our cumulative use cal-
culations.

Our analysis found that talc use and EOC risk varied by histo-
logic subtype, as have others who found that exposure to talc is a
significant risk for invasive tumors? and specifically for serous
invasive tumors.?! Cook et al.'! also found an increased risk of
serous tumors (including both invasive and borderline) in talc
users versus nonusers. Gertig et al.?” have suggested that there are
pathologic similarities between serous adenocarcinomas and me-
sothelioma that may explain findings of increase risk for serous
invasive tumors in talc users. Harlow et al.?+ reported a significant
increase in risk of either endometrioid or borderline tumors with
talc use and suggest that variation in risk among histologic sub-
types may be due to chance or a foreign-body effect unique to
specific subtypes.

In a study of the mineral and chemical characterization of
consumer talcum powder formulated prior to June 1973, almost
half of the samples tested contained 1 of the 3 asbestos group
minerals.'! In 1976, talcum powder manufacturers instituted vol-
untary guidelines to prevent asbestos contamination in talc prod-
ucts,”4 but we did not find an increase in EOC risk with talc use on
or before 1975; rather, we found that risk of EOC increased with
use after 1975, which may be related to the recency of use. Harlow
et al. observed ovarian cancer risk was increased in women using
talc products before 1960, although Chang and Risch?? found no
relationship between risk and use either before or after 1970.

In the current analysis, a statistically significant increase in EOC
risk occurred with first use after age 20 compared to first use at
younger ages. Controlling for recency of use did not change this
finding. Other studies have reported either no trend with age at first
use?! or increased risk of EOC with first use at younger than age
20 and older than age 25.74 Disagreement in findings between
studies may be due to differences in age distributions and talc use
patterns among study participants. Although we cannot directly
assess risk during ovulatory versus nonovulatory periods, our

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ijc.20434

findings of increased risk in adult women support the hypotheses
of increased EOC risk with talc exposure during ovulatory periods
and in parous reproductive tracts.

Cramer et al.?! found that EOC risk was increased in parous
women with talc use occurring before first birth, suggesting that
prepregnancy ovarian tissue may be more vulnerable to talc dam-
age because it has not undergone stromal differentiation (decidual
reaction that occurs during pregnancy). However, their reference
group was all parous women. In this analysis, we stratified parous
women by never use, use before first birth and use after first birth.
We found increased risk after first pregnancy. Anatomical changes
in the genital tract after pregnancy may increase the possibility of
talc migration to the ovaries.?8 Harlow et al.?* suggest that preg-
nancy may increase risk due to its effect of increasing the size of
the cervical opening into the uterus. In the current study, perineal
talc use had no apparent impact on EOC risk among those women
who had never been pregnant and parity was difficult to evaluate
because of the small number of nulliparous women. In 2 prospec-
tive studies of talc use and EOC risk, there was no significant
difference in parity between users and nonusers of talc.?5.27

Harlow et al.” reported a significant increase in EOC risk if
perineal talc use occurred in the last 6 months. We also found that
recent users were at increased risk (even when we controlled for
duration of use). It is noteworthy that a significant latency effect is
well documented for asbestos exposure and development of both
pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas”? while there appears to be no
latency with talcum powder. The asbestos association has been re-
ported from an occupational cohort mortality study where exposure is
indirect and not the result of direct application, as is the case for
talcum powder.*° This may explain the differences between observed
pattems of latency for asbestos and talcum powder. Additionally, risk
of EOC with talc use may not be due to talc’s chemical similarity to
asbestos but rather due to the ovary’s unique function, resulting in
vulnerability to carcinogenesis from particulates such as talc.8 In a
study of gynecologic surgery and EOC, Green et al.*! found that
women reporting fallopian tubal occlusion, through tubal ligation or
hysterectomy, were at decreased risk for developing EOC. They
concluded that surgical tubal occlusion decreased EOC risk by pre-
venting contaminants from reaching the ovary. Ness and Cottreau??
proposed that the inflammatory response of the ovarian epithelium to
various irritants may result in ovarian mutagenesis, tumor growth and
tumor invasiveness. Cramer et al.?' reported no association between
EOC risk and talc use in women with a tubal ligation; however, risk
remained nonsignificantly elevated in women with a hysterectomy. A
recent prospective study?’ found that EOC risk in talc users was not
modified by either tubal ligation or hysterectomy. The analysis was
not able to determine the timing of talc use (before or after surgery).
Ina hospital-based case-control study, Wong et al.33 found that risk of
EOC with talc use was increased in women without gynecologic
surgery and decreased in women with a history of tubal ligation or
hysterectomy but neither finding was significant. They also were
unable to delineate use before or after gynecologic surgery. Tubal
ligation may limit a woman’s exposure to contaminants more than
hysterectomy since it is usually performed earlier in a woman’s
reproductive history, while she is still ovulating.3+

Oral contraceptives (OCs) act by suppression of ovulation and
the fact that elevated risks were found in those talcum powder
users that never used OCs in this study suggests that uninterrupted
ovulation with associated formation of inclusion cysts may en-
hance the impact that talcum powder may have on ovarian carci-
nogenesis. Unlike our study, however, Cramer et al.?! and Harlow
et al.”4 reported that OCs had no effect on talc use and EOC risk.
A prospective study of talc use and ovarian cancer also found that
the prevalence of OC use was similar in both users and nonusers
of talc. However, these studies also reported lower percentages of
OC use among both cases and controls (talc users and nonusers)
than was found in the present study.

Our analysis found that BMI did not modify the risk associated
with talc use and EOC in agreement with Cramer et al.?! Talc use

was greater in women with a high versus low BMI for both cases
and controls but the difference was not significant. Rosenblatt et
al.25 in a prospective study found that women in the highest BMI
quartile were more likely to use perineal talc. They concluded that
since some studies have found an increased risk for ovarian cancer
in obese women, BMI may be a confounder of talc use and ovarian
cancer risk. Harlow et al.,?+ however, reported no differential use
of talc between leaner and heavier controls.

There are several limitations to this study that may limit interpre-
tation of the findings. The sample size was relatively small and the
response fraction lower than ideal. However, we have observed the
same or similar relationships in our study between several risk factors
such as OC use and parity, as has been observed in several earlier
studies. Recall bias has also been implicated as a limitation in studies
of talc and ovarian cancer.*> However, findings in a prospective study,
the Nurses’ Health Study, in which exposure data were collected prior
to diagnosis and hence free of recall bias, were similar to the present
study finding for talc use and serous invasive ovarian cancer.’ It has
also been suggested that use of talc is habitual versus memorable and
not likely to be subject to recall bias.35 Huncharek et al.4 suggested
that the positive relationship between talc use and EOC risk found in
a review of epidemiologic studies may also be explained by a treat-
ment effect in prevalent cases. The present study used incident cases

exclusively. The present analysis was also limited due to our inability
to exclude use during nonovulatory periods and posttubal ligation or
hysterectomy, nor were we able to differentiate between various
formulations.

Research has provided little biologic or experimental evidence to
support a relationship between talcum powder use and ovarian cancer
risk. However, given the suggestive though uncertain role of talcum
powder and EOC found in epidemiologic studies, including the
present study, users should exercise prudence in reducing or elimi-
nating use. In this instance, the precautionary principle should be
invoked, especially given that this is a serious form of cancer, usually
associated with a poor prognosis, with no current effective screening
tool, steady incidence rates during the last quarter century and no
prospect for successful therapy. Unlike other forms of environmental
exposures, talcum powder use is easily avoidable.
