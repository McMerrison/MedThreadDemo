Key Points

Question

Is use of powder in the genital area associated with the risk of developing ovarian cancer?

Findings

https://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990816/?report=printable Page 3 of 23
Association of Powder Use in the Genital Area With Risk of Ovarian Cancer - PMC 6/6/23, 5:50 PM
In this analysis that pooled data from 4 cohorts with a total of 252 745 women, the hazard ratio for the

association between self-reported ever use vs never use of powder in the genital area and incident
ovarian cancer was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99-1.17).

Meaning

Among women from 4 prospective cohorts, there was not a statistically significant association between
use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer, but the study may have been underpowered to
identify a small increase in risk.

Abstract

Importance

The relationship between use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer is not established.
Positive associations reported in case-control studies have not been confirmed in cohort studies.

Objective

To estimate the association between use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer using
prospective observational data.

Design, Setting, and Participants

Data were pooled from 4 large, US-based cohorts: Nurses’ Health Study (enrollment 1976; follow-up
1982-2016; n = 81 869), Nurses’ Health Study II (enrollment 1989; follow-up 2013-2017; n= 61 261),
Sister Study (enrollment 2003-2009; follow-up 2003-2017; n= 40 647), and Women’s Health Initiative
Observational Study (enrollment 1993-1998; follow-up 1993-2017; n = 73 267).

Exposures

Ever, long-term (>20 years), and frequent (> 1/week) use of powder in the genital area.

Main Outcomes and Measures

https://www.ncbi.nim.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990816/?report=printable Page 4 of 23
Association of Powder Use in the Genital Area With Risk of Ovarian Cancer - PMC 6/6/23, 5:50 PM

The primary analysis examined the association between ever use of powder in the genital area and self-
reported incident ovarian cancer. Covariate-adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% Cls were estimated
using Cox proportional hazards models.

Results

The pooled sample included 252 745 women (median age at baseline, 57 years) with 38% self-reporting
use of powder in the genital area. Ten percent reported long-term use, and 22% reported frequent use.
During a median of 11.2 years of follow-up (3.8 million person-years at risk), 2168 women developed
ovarian cancer (58 cases/100 000 person-years). Ovarian cancer incidence was 61 cases/100 000
person-years among ever users and 55 cases/100 000 person-years among never users (estimated risk
difference at age 70 years, 0.09% [95% CI, —0.02% to 0.19%]; estimated HR, 1.08 [95% CI, 0.99 to
1.17]). The estimated HR for frequent vs never use was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.97 to 1.23) and for long-term
vs never use, the HR was 1.01 (95% CL, 0.82 to 1.25). Subgroup analyses were conducted for 10
variables; the tests for heterogeneity were not statistically significant for any of these comparisons.
While the estimated HR for the association between ever use of powder in the genital area and ovarian
cancer risk among women with a patent reproductive tract was 1.13 (95% CI, 1.01 to 1.26), the P value
for interaction comparing women with vs without patent reproductive tracts was .15.

Conclusions and Relevance

In this analysis of pooled data from women in 4 US cohorts, there was not a statistically significant
association between use of powder in the genital area and incident ovarian cancer. However, the study
may have been underpowered to identify a small increase in risk.

Introduction

Some women apply powder to their genitals, either through direct application or on underwear, sanitary
napkins, diaphragms or tampons. Most powder products include some mineral talc. Talc was first
investigated as a carcinogen based on its relationship to asbestos, which has known carcinogenic
effects? and may be mined in the same locations. However, all US-based manufacturers of cosmetic talc
agreed to ban asbestos in 1976, and the International Agency for Research on Cancer has since
concluded there is only “possible” evidence that perineal use of talc-based body powder may be

carcinogenic.

This classification was largely based on evidence from observational studies. Case-control studies have

reported positive associations between ever use of powder in the genital area and ovarian cancer, with
an estimated odds ratio of 1.24 in a pooled analysis* and 1.31 in a meta-analysis.2 However, these

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990816/?report=printable Page 5 of 23

findings may be affected by recall bias,°7 and a recent surge in talc-related lawsuits and media
coverage®” has increased this possibility. Thus, it is crucial to evaluate the talc—ovarian cancer

association using prospective data.

To date, 3 large cohort studies have assessed the association between use of powder in the genital area
and ovarian cancer risk, with inconsistent results.12-2 However, ovarian cancer is a rare disease
(1.3% lifetime risk in the United States),!* and individual cohort studies are not sufficiently powered to
detect modest associations, particularly if restricted to susceptible subgroups, such as women with
patent reproductive tracts (ie, having an intact uterus and no tubal ligation).

To better examine the association between use of powder in the genital area and risk of ovarian cancer,
4 large US cohorts that collected the necessary information were identified: the Nurses’ Health Study
(NHS), Nurses’ Health Study II (NHSII), Sister Study (SIS), and Women’s Health Initiative
Observational Study (WHI-OS). While associations between genital use of powder and ovarian cancer
risk have been reported for 3 of these (NHS, WHI-OS, and SIS),!°!!2 the pooled results reported here
incorporate updated data, including additional cases and longer follow-up.

Methods

Study Sample

The study designs of these 4 US-based cohorts have been described in detail elsewhere.!*!>-!° Briefly,
the NHS (n= 121 700) enrolled registered nurses living in the United States in 1976, and the NHSII (n
= 116 429) did the same in 1989. The study protocols were approved by the institutional review boards
of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, and those of
participating registries, as required. All participants provided written, informed consent. Although the
initial questionnaires did not ask about genital use of powder, participants were queried about powder
use on the 1982 NHS and 2013 NHSII questionnaires. We only included follow-up time after the
questionnaire about use of powder in the genital area was administered and will refer to the
questionnaire that assessed powder use as baseline to maintain consistent language across all 4 studies.

Genital use of powder was assessed at enrollment for SIS between 2003 and 2009 (n = 50 884) and for
WHI-OS between 1993 and 1998 (n = 93 676). Women were eligible for SIS if they had a sister
previously diagnosed with breast cancer but had no personal diagnosis of breast cancer at enrollment.
Eligible participants in WHI-OS were postmenopausal women who resided near one of 40 clinical
centers. Both studies were approved by the relevant institutional review boards and all participants
provided written, informed consent.

Exposure Assessment

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990816/?report=printable Page 6 of 23
Association of Powder Use in the Genital Area With Risk of Ovarian Cancer - PMC 6/6/23, 5:50 PM

The cohorts differed in how they asked participants about use of powder in the genital area (eAppendix
in the Supplement). NHS participants were asked whether they “ever commonly used talcum, baby
powder or deodorizing powder” on their “perineal (private) area” (no, <1/week, 1-6 times/week, daily)
or on sanitary napkins (yes/no). The NHSII questionnaire asked women to report use only if it occurred
at least weekly in the “genital/rectal area or on sanitary napkins, tampons, or underwear” and if so, for
how long (<1 year, 1-<10 years, 10-<20 years, 20-<30 years, 30+ years). In SIS, the question
specifically focused on use of talcum powder and application to “a sanitary napkin, underwear,
diaphragm, or cervical cap, or directly to the vaginal area” in the last year or at the ages of 10 to 13
years. Participants were queried about their frequency of use in the year prior to enrollment (never,
<1/mo, 1-3 times/mo, 1-5 times/week, >5 times/week), as well as use during the ages 10-13 (did not
use, sometimes, frequently). Women in WHI-OS were asked if they had ever used powder on their
“private parts (genital areas)” (yes/no) and for how long they had used it (<1 year, 1-4 years, 5-9 years,
10-19 years, 20+ years), with similar questions for powder use on diaphragms or sanitary pads.

To harmonize across the 4 studies, we defined women as ever vs never users of powder on genital areas.
For SIS, ever use included use in the last year or at ages 10 to 13 years. We were also able to examine
long-term use, which we defined as use of powder on genitals for at least 20 years (NHSII and WHI-
OS) or use at ages 10 to 13 years and also in the last year (SIS). Frequent users were those who
reported use of powder in the genital area at least once per week (NHS, NHSID), at least once per week
in the last year, or “frequently” during ages of 10 to 13 years (SIS).

Outcome Assessment

For NHS and NHSIL, follow-up questionnaires were distributed every 2 years, at which point
participants were asked to report recent cancer diagnoses. Those reporting incident cancers were asked
to grant access to their medical records, which were reviewed for confirmation of the diagnosis and
disease details. Additional cases were identified from among deceased participants via National Death
Index searches. The protocol for SIS was similar, except follow-up questionnaires were collected
annually and most participants provided pathology reports rather than complete medical records.
Participants in WHI-OS were also asked to self-report cancers on annual questionnaires, but only
medically confirmed cases were counted. All 4 studies categorized tumors originating in the ovary,
peritoneum, and fallopian tubes as ovarian cancers.

For NHS, NHSIL and SIS, delays in the confirmation process and incomplete retrieval of medical
records meant that not all self-reported cases could be medically confirmed. We ran sensitivity analyses

limited to medically confirmed cases but included all self-reported diagnoses in our main analyses.
Subtype analyses were limited to medically confirmed cases.

Covariates

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990816/?report=printable Page 7 of 23
Association of Powder Use in the Genital Area With Risk of Ovarian Cancer - PMC 6/6/23, 5:50 PM

All 4 studies had substantial covariate data, which we harmonized into a common set of potential
confounders or effect modifiers. The following data were included: age at baseline (continuous), race
(white, black, other), education (<high school, some college, completed college), body mass index
(BMI [calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared], restricted cubic spline),
parity (nulliparous, | birth, 2 births, >3 births), smoking status (never, former, current), oral
contraceptive use (ever/never), hormone therapy use (ever/never), tubal ligation status (yes/no),
hysterectomy status (yes/no), and menopausal status (premenopausal/postmenopausal). Race was self-
reported by the participant, based on provided categories. It was considered to be an important
confounder because both ovarian cancer rates and genital powder use vary by race/ethnicity. Only
baseline levels of these covariates were considered as confounders, though we did consider postbaseline
changes in menopausal status when assessing effect modification.

Statistical Analyses

We used Cox proportional hazards models with age as the primary time scale to estimate hazard ratios
(HRs) and 95% CIs measuring the association between genital use of powder and incident ovarian
cancer, adjusting for potential confounders. We selected potential confounders using a directed acyclic
graph framework,!“ considering covariates that were possibly related to use of powder in the genital
area and also ovarian cancer risk.

We excluded women who had ovarian cancer or a bilateral oophorectomy prior to baseline, or who
were missing information on powder use or age at ovarian cancer diagnosis. For regression analyses,
we additionally excluded women with missing data for 1 or more covariates. Women underwent follow-
up from age at baseline until ovarian cancer diagnosis, with censoring at bilateral oophorectomy, end of
follow-up, or death from causes other than ovarian cancer. An exception was made for WHI-OS
because postbaseline oophorectomy data were not collected. Participants in SIS and WHI-OS who were
no longer actively responding to follow-up requests were censored at age of last contact, although their
follow-up continued via linkage to the National Death Index.

To better control for differences across studies, we allowed the baseline hazard function to vary across
cohorts by implementing study-stratified Cox models. We tested for study heterogeneity by conducting
likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without study x powder interaction terms. For the
primary analysis of ever vs never powder use and ovarian cancer risk, we additionally calculated the
effect estimate and the P value for heterogeneity from a random-effects meta-analysis.1® Proportional
hazards assumptions were tested via likelihood ratio tests of powder x time interaction terms.

Because patency is required for there to be a direct physical pathway between the powder application
area and the ovaries, we hypothesized a priori that women with patent reproductive tracts would be
more susceptible to the effects of powder use in the genital area on ovarian cancer. We therefore
conducted analyses restricted to this subgroup. When estimating the effects of duration of powder use

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6990816/?report=printable Page 8 of 23
Association of Powder Use in the Genital Area With Risk of Ovarian Cancer - PMC 6/6/23, 5:50 PM

on ovarian cancer risk, we compared long-term (>20 years) and non—long-term users with never users.
Similarly, we compared frequent users (>1/week) and nonfrequent users with never users. We
conducted trend tests using the ordinal forms of these variables.

We also conducted exploratory analyses to examine whether the association between powder use in the
genital area and ovarian cancer varied by subgroup. These categorizations were selected based on the
existing literature or hypotheses about potential biological mechanisms and included age, race/ethnicity,
menopausal hormone therapy use, BMI, and parity. We also considered time-varying menopausal status
and follow-up time as effect modifiers and more formally compared subgroups defined by hysterectomy,
tubal ligation and patency status. We evaluated heterogeneity across strata of each potential effect
modifier by conducting likelihood ratio tests of the interaction between that factor and powder use in
the genital area.

For analyses limited to medically confirmed cases of ovarian cancer, we censored unconfirmed cases at
their self-reported age of diagnosis. For type-specific analyses, the medically confirmed cases were
further divided by invasiveness status (invasive vs borderline), tumor location (epithelial ovarian,
peritoneal, or fallopian tube), or histotype (serous, endometroid, mucinous, clear-cell, or other). For an
alternative histotype analysis, we defined high-grade serous as grades 2 to 4 serous or grades 3 to 4
endometroid tumors.12 We estimated the HRs for each set of subtypes using joint Cox proportional
hazards models,” utilizing likelihood ratio tests to compare model fit for models that did and did not
allow the main-effect estimates to differ by subtype. These test results are reported as P values for
heterogeneity.

In a sensitivity analysis, we attempted to isolate participants who were possibly exposed to asbestos-
contaminated talc by limiting analysis to women in WHI-OS and NHS, most of whom were born before
1945. In the age-adjusted and fully adjusted models, we additionally estimated cumulative risk of
ovarian cancer by age 70 years and assessed differences in absolute risk among ever vs never users of
powder in the genital area using the Breslow method.24

Statistical tests were 2-sided, and a P value less than .05 was considered statistically significant.
Because of the potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons, findings from subgroup and

sensitivity analyses should be interpreted as exploratory. All analyses were conducted in SAS 9.4.

Results

After initial exclusions, we had data from 257 044 women, including 2213 who developed incident
ovarian cancer (Table 1). Use of powder in the genital area was common overall (39%) but varied by
cohort with 53% of participants reporting ever use in WHI-OS, 41% in NHS, 27% in SIS, and 26% in
NHSIL Long-term use was reported by 16% in WHI-OS and by 6% in both SIS and NHSIL,; frequent
use was reported by 27% in NHS, 26% in NHSIL, and 7% in SIS.

After further excluding women with missing covariates (<3% of all participants), 2168 participants
with ovarian cancer (1884 medically confirmed) and 250577 without ovarian cancer remained. Most
NHS and WHI-OS participants were born between 1915 and 1944 and most NHSII and SIS
participants were born in 1945 or later (eTable 1 in the Supplement), and there appeared to be a
generational trend in use of powder in the genital area, with older cohorts more likely to report use.
Overall, this was a highly educated group (most completed college) and most participants were white
(84%-98% of each cohort). Compared with never users, ever users of powder in the genital area were
more likely to be black (6% vs 3%; eTable 2 in the Supplement), to be obese (26% vs 19%), or to have
had a hysterectomy (22% vs 18%), and less likely to have used oral contraceptives (57% vs 64%).

A total of 2168 women developed ovarian cancer (58 cases per 100 000 person-years; Table 2).
Consistent with mean age at enrollment, incidence was highest in WHI-OS (63 cases per 100 000
person-years) and lowest in NHSII (34 cases per 100 000 person-years). In the pooled sample,
estimated crude cumulative incidence of ovarian cancer at age 70 years was 1.3%, with higher risk
among participants in NHS (1.3%) and SIS (1.4%) than in NHSII (0.7%) or WHI-OS (0.9%).

Considering all 4 cohorts, the estimated incidence of ovarian cancer was 61 per 100 000 person-years
among ever users and 55 among never users. The estimated adjusted cumulative risk of ovarian cancer
by age 70 years among unexposed participants was 1.16%, with an estimated covariate-adjusted risk
difference of 0.09% (95% CI, —0.02% to 0.19%) comparing with those who were exposed. The HR for
the association between ever powder use and incident ovarian cancer was 1.08 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.17;
Table 2). There was no evidence of heterogeneity across cohorts (P value for heterogeneity = .81) and
no evidence of a proportional hazards assumption violation (P > .99). The estimated HR from the
random-effects model was 1.07 (95% CL, 0.98 to 1.17; P value for heterogeneity = .71).

When restricted to women with patent reproductive tracts at baseline, the HR was 1.13 (95% CL, 1.01 to
1.26) and the estimated covariate-adjusted risk difference was 0.15% (95% CI, 0.01% to 0.29%).
Among women without patent reproductive tracts, the estimated HR was 0.99 (95% CI, 0.86 to 1.15)
and the P value for heterogeneity comparing the result for women with patency vs without was .15 (
Figure). The remaining stratified analyses are also presented in the Figure and in eTable 3 in the
Supplement.

The covariate-adjusted risk difference for long-term (>20 years) vs never use was 0.01% (95% CI,
—0.21% to 0.24%), and the HR was 1.01 (95% CI, 0.82 to 1.25; P value for trend = .57; Table 3). The
covariate-adjusted risk difference for frequent use (>1/week) vs none was 0.10% (95% CI, —0.05% to
0.25%), and the HR was 1.09 (95% CL, 0.97 to 1.23; dose-response P value for trend =.20). The
covariate-adjusted risk difference for the association between frequent powder use and ovarian cancer
among women with patent reproductive tracts was 0.22% (95% CI, 0.02% to 0.42%), and the HR was
1.19 (95% CI, 1.03 to 1.37; P value for trend = .03).

When the outcome was limited to medically confirmed cases, the HR was attenuated (Table 4; HR, 1.05
[95% CI, 0.96 to 1.16] for ever use vs never use). There were no notable differences in estimates by
invasive status, tumor location, or histotype. This was also true for analyses limited to women with
patent reproductive tracts (eTable 4 in the Supplement). When limited to the older cohorts (NHS and
WHI-OS), the estimated pooled HR was 1.09 (95% CI, 0.99 to 1.19) for ever use vs never use. The
estimated HR from the young cohorts (NHSII and SIS) was 0.97 (95% CI, 0.75 to 1.26).

Discussion

In this pooled analysis of 4 large US cohorts, there was no statistically significant association between
self-reported use of powder in the genital area and risk of ovarian cancer. There were no clear dose-
response trends for duration and frequency of powder use in the genital area in relation to ovarian
cancer risk. Although the study was underpowered to detect small changes in risk, this is, to our
knowledge, the largest study of this topic to date, and it is believed that no other large prospective
cohorts have collected data on powder exposure in the genital area.

One of the primary drivers of research on genital use of talc-based products and ovarian cancer has
been the potential link between talc and asbestos, which can occur together in nature. In an analysis
limited to the older cohorts in which women may have started using powder before the asbestos ban of
1976, the estimated effect remained consistent, with no association observed in the younger cohorts.
However, it was recently suggested that some products may have contained asbestos after 1976,
meaning that there may not be a clearly defined time period in which talc-based products did or did not
contain asbestos.22 Further, although most cosmetic powder products include some quantity of mineral
talc,! the percentage varies widely,* and exposure to asbestos (through talc) would also depend on the
type of product used and the method of application (eg, underwear vs diaphragm).

By irritating epithelial ovarian tissue or fallopian tubes™ directly, powder could induce an
inflammatory response even in the absence of asbestos. This could set off a cascade of increased
oxidative stress levels, DNA damage, and cell division, all of which could contribute to
carcinogenesis.?> In this analysis, there was a possible positive association among women with patent
reproductive tracts (no history of hysterectomy or tubal ligation), although because the association was
not significantly different from that observed in women with nonpatent reproductive tracts, this finding
should be considered only exploratory and hypothesis generating. This observation lends support to the
hypothesis that powder with or without asbestos could irritate and inflame the reproductive tract, as
patency | is required for there to be a direct physical path between the genitals and the fallopian | tubes or
ovaries.2° The positive relationships between pelvic inflammatory disease and ovarian cancer~ and
chlamydia infection and ovarian cancer® also support an inflammation-mediated mechanism, as does

the inverse association between regular aspirin use and ovarian cancer.”

One of the main concerns about previous case-control studies on this topic is the possibility for recall
bias, which would result if case participants were more likely to report using powder than control
participants. As highlighted by Trabert,2 the African American Cancer Epidemiology Study® found
evidence supporting this phenomenon. Based on the timing of the first major talc lawsuits,>2
Schildkraut et al stratified their results by year of interview (earlier than 2014 vs 2014 or later),
observing that among women interviewed earlier, ever use of powder in the genital area was less-
strongly associated with ovarian cancer (odds ratio [OR], 1.19 [95% CI, 0.87 to 1.63]) than among
women interviewed later (OR, 2.91 [95% CI, 1.70 to 4.97]). This difference was driven by an increase
in the reported prevalence of powder use among case participants (36.5% vs 51.5% of women
interviewed early vs later), while self-reported use in the control partcipants remained stable (34.0% vs
34.4%). However, most of the case-control studies that have examined this association recruited well
before 2014, and a large pooled analysis published in 2013 reported an OR of 1.24 (95% CI, 1.15 to
1.33).4 For the current analysis, recall bias was avoided by excluding those with preexisting ovarian
cancer.

The strengths of this study were large sample size and long follow-up time. The main analysis included
2168 ovarian cancer cases that developed over 3.8 million person-years. This far exceeds a previous
meta-analysis of the published NHS, SIS, and WHI-OS results (890 cases over 182 000 person-years).2
However, power to investigate links to peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers or histotypes other than
serous was still low. Improvements in the classification of tumor types may contribute new insights,
especially for fallopian tube cancers, which may be the true point of origin for most serous ovarian
cancers.~* This and other subtype-specific associations should be better examined in the future.

Limitations

This study has several limitations. First, the included cohorts varied widely in how they assessed
exposure, particularly the duration and frequency of powder use. There was no evidence of between-
study heterogeneity for either the pooled or meta-analysis models of ever use vs never use, but because
the 2 largest studies were missing information on duration (NHS) and frequency (WHI-OS) of powder
use, the dose-response analyses are underpowered compared with the main results and thus difficult to
interpret. Second, use of powder in the genital area could not be assessed as a time-varying factor, as
none of the 4 studies collected data on use after baseline.

Third, specific exposure windows could not be examined, nor could type of powder used or patency
status at time of powder use. As previously noted, information on powder exposure is typically more
limited in cohort studies compared with case-control studies, particularly with respect to dose and
duration of use.*! Therefore, ongoing or future cohort studies should collect detailed information on
these topics.

Fourth, as with all observational studies, residual confounding is possible. All 4 included studies
recorded detailed information on many potential confounders, which were harmonized across cohorts
and adjusted for in multivariable models. However, residual confounding may still be present if the
harmonized covariates did not adequately capture the relationship or if any key confounders were
missing.

Fifth, the study may have limited generalizability. All 4 cohorts included predominately white, well-
educated women, approximately half of whom had a BMI of less than 25, which could raise concerns
about generalizability, especially since these factors may be related to powder use. However, these
studies have high retention rates and accurate self-reported data, increasing internal validity.

Sixth, confounding by indication is another potential limitation, and it would occur if women with other
underlying conditions that were associated with ovarian cancer were also more likely to use powder in
the genital area. It is also possible that if powder use is associated with increased risk of other
gynecologic conditions (eg, fibroids, ovarian cysts), it can affect whether women receive
oophorectomies, hysterectomies, or tubal ligations and alter their risk of developing ovarian cancer.
Seventh, because tests to confirm patency were not performed, it is possible that not all women
categorized as having a patent reproductive tract in this analysis had truly patent tubes.

Conclusions

In this analysis of pooled data from women in 4 US cohorts, there was not a statistically significant
association between self-reported use of powder in the genital area and incident ovarian cancer.
However, the study may have been underpowered to identify a small increase in risk.

Powder use in the genital area was assessed in the 1982 follow-up questionnaire, not at study baseline. Participants were
excluded if they did not respond to the question regarding use of powder in the genital area (n = 28 584), had ovarian cancer
prior to responding to the 1982 questionnaire (n = 174), underwent a bilateral oophorectomy at the time of the 1982
questionnaire (n = 10 896), or did not contribute any person-time after the 1982 questionnaire (n = 4). Frequent use was defined
as use of powder in the genital area at least once per week. Women who underwent bilateral oophorectomy during follow-up
were censored at age of oophorectomy. Follow-up was complete through June 1, 2016.

contribute any person-time after the 2013 questionnaire (n = 1). Frequent use was defined as use of powder in the genital area at
least once per week. Long-term use was defined as use of powder in the genital area for 20 years or longer. Because data were
reported in 2-year cycles, we did not censor for oophorectomy that occurred after 2013. Follow-up was complete through June
1, 2017.

‘Participants were excluded if they withdrew from the study (n = 2), had ovarian cancer prior to baseline or unclear ovarian
cancer status at baseline (n = 225), underwent a bilateral oophorectomy prior to baseline (n = 9009), or did not respond to any
of the questions regarding use of powder in the genital area (n = 1001). Ever powder use was defined as use of powder in the
genital area during the 12 months prior to baseline or at ages 10 to 13 years. Long-term use was defined as use of powder in the
genital area at ages 10 to 13 years and within the last 12 months. Frequent use was defined as use of powder in the genital area
at least once per week (during the last 12 months) or frequently (as termed in the questionnaire) between ages 10 and 13 years.
Women who underwent a bilateral oophorectomy during follow-up were censored at age of oophorectomy. Follow-up was
complete through September 15, 2017.

Participants were excluded if they did not complete the questionnaire regarding use of powder in the genital area (n = 342),
had ovarian cancer before baseline (n = 641) or unknown cancer status before baseline (n = 890), underwent a bilateral
oophorectomy at baseline (n = 18 183), or had no follow-up information (n = 353). Long-term use was defined as use of powder
in the genital area for 20 years or longer. Postbaseline oophorectomies were not recorded. Follow-up was complete through

February 28, 2017.

bReferent group is never users. Effect estimates and HRs for women with patency were adjusted for race/ethnicity (white, black,

other), education (< high school, some college, >college graduate), body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided

by height in meters squared, [restricted cubic spline]), parity (0, 1, 2, >3 births), ever use for oral contraceptives, tubal ligation

(yes or no), hysterectomy status (yes or no), menopausal status (premenopausal or postmenopausal), and ever use of hormone
therapy. Only effect estimates were adjusted for tubal ligation status (yes or no) and for hysterectomy status (yes or no). All

covariates indicate status at time of assessment for use of powder in the genital area. RDs were calculated based on estimated

cumulative incidence of ovarian cancer by age 70 years.

“Pooled estimates were calculated using Cox proportional hazards models, stratified by study to allow for the baseline hazard
functions to vary by cohort, and adjusted for the same covariates as the study-specific models.

The P value for heterogeneity between studies was .81 and was calculated using the likelihood ratio test for study by main-
effects interaction term.
