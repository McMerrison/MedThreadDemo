A Retrospective Case-Control Study in Two US States

Background: Multiple studies of ovarian cancer and genital tale use
have led only to consensus about possible carcinogenicity. Seeking
greater clarity, we examined this association in 2,041 cases with epi-
thelial ovarian cancer and 2,100 age- and-residence-matched controls.
Methods: We defined genital talc use as regular application to the geni-
tal/rectal area directly, on sanitary napkins, tampons, or underwear. To
estimate “talc-years,” we multiplied applications per year by years used.
Unconditional logistic regression, Wald statistics, likelihood-ratio tests,
and polytomous logistic regression were used to calculate adjusted odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI), trends, effect-modifica-
tion, and heterogeneity by ovarian cancer histologic subtype.

Results: Overall, genital talc use was associated with an OR (95%
Cl) of 1.33 (1.16, 1.52), with a trend for increasing risk by talc-
years. Women who used talc were more likely to be older, heavier,
asthma sufferers, and regular analgesic users—none of which was a
confounder. Dose-responses were more apparent for premenopausal
women, especially nonsmokers and those heavier or postmenopausal
users of menopausal hormones (hormone therapy [HT]). Subtypes
of ovarian cancer more likely to be associated with tale included
invasive serous and endometrioid tumors and borderline serous and
mucinous tumors. Premenopausal women and postmenopausal HT
users with these subtypes who had accumulated >24 talc-years had
ORs (95% CI) of 2.33 (1.32, 4.12) and 2.57 (1.51, 4.36), respectively.

Conclusion: Risks for epithelial ovarian cancer from genital talc use
vary by histologic subtype, menopausal status at diagnosis, HT use,
weight, and smoking. These observations suggest that estrogen and/
or prolactin may play a role via macrophage activity and inflamma-
tory response to talc.

| n the 1960s, a link between talc and ovarian cancer was sug-
gested by observations that some talc powders contained
asbestos! and that asbestos placed intraperitoneally in ani-
mals transformed the single layer of the ovarian surface to a
multilayered one with abnormal cells.? A 1971 study found
particles compatible with talc in human ovarian and uter-
ine cancers.> A 1982 case-control study was the first to link
genital talc use with ovarian cancer.* Dozens more followed
confirming the association including some larger ones cited
here.*'> The most recent meta-analysis reported a summary
odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of 1.35
(1.26, 1.46).'* In 2006, the International Agency for Research
on Cancer declared that talc used genitally is possibly carcino-
genic.'> However, a study with null results from the Women’s
Health Initiative (WHI)'° and accompanying editorial!” cast
new skepticism on the association. Here, we present data from
combined phases of a case-control study of ovarian cancer
involving more than 4,000 women to provide fresh perspec-
tives on this association.

METHODS

Study Population

Data come from three enrollment phases: 1 (1992—
1997), 2 (1998-2002), and 3 (2003-2008). Articles we previ-
ously published related to talc include a detailed report from
phase 1,’ data from phases 1 and 2 combined with Nurses’
Health Study data,'® and phases 1-3 data combined with data
from several participants in the Ovarian Cancer Association
Consortium (OCAC).'? This is the first detailed examination
of talc data from the combined phases of our study.

Details regarding enrollment are described elsewhere.?°
In brief, 3,957 women residing in Eastern Massachusetts and
New Hampshire diagnosed with ovarian cancer between ages
18 and 80 were identified through tumor boards and registries.

Ovarian Cancer and Talc

Eight hundred and seventy-four cases were ineligible if they
had died, moved outside study area, did not have a working
telephone number, or had a nonovarian primary tumor. Of the
remaining 3,083 cases, 2,203 (71%) were enrolled. Excluding
127 nonepithelial and 35 mixed mesodermal tumors, 2,041
cases with epithelial tumors of ovarian, primary peritoneal,
and Fallopian tube origin, including borderline malignancies
(henceforth, epithelial ovarian cancer) were included. Pathol-
ogy reports were reviewed and histologic subtype, grade, and
stage recorded. Mixed epithelial ovarian cancer was classified
as the predominant type. Undifferentiated, transitional cell,
fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal tumors were counted as
serous.”! Other mixed epithelial (n = 102), malignant Brenner
(n = 5), and unspecified epithelial tumors (n = 27) were clas-
sified as other.

Controls were identified through random digit dialing,
driver-license lists, and town-resident lists. Between 1992 and
1997, 420 (72%) identified through random digit dialing and
102 (51%) through lists agreed to participate. From 1998 to
2008, 4,366 potential controls were identified using the lists,
of whom 1,426 (33%) were ineligible if they had died, moved,
or were seriously ill or if they did not have a working tele-
phone, speak English, or have ovaries. Of eligible controls,
1,362 (46%) declined to participate by phone or via “opt-out”
postcard and 1,578 (54%) were enrolled (2,100 total). Con-
trols were frequency matched to cases by 5-year age groups
and region of residence.

Exposure Assessment

Subjects were personally interviewed about potential
ovarian cancer risk factors that occurred more than | year
before diagnosis, for cases, and interview, for controls. Sub-
jects were asked whether they “regularly” or “at least monthly”
applied powder to the genital or rectal area, sanitary napkins
or tampons, underwear, or areas other than the genital-rectal
area. Additional details included type of powder, age begun,
years used, and applications per month. Lifetime exposure
was estimated by multiplying frequency of applications per
month by months used. This was divided by 360 (i.e., daily use
coded as 30/month) to yield talc-years. To create categorical
variables for talc-years, we chose cut points based on quar-
tiles for exposed controls and rounded to the nearest integer.
In addition, we asked participants if their partners dusted or
sprayed powder to their genital or rectal areas. Condom and
diaphragm use as potential sources of tale exposure were also
recorded.

We calculated ovulatory cycles by subtracting age at
menarche from age at last period, reduced this by time spent
pregnant, breastfeeding, or using oral contraceptives, and
dividing the remainder by each woman’s average cycle length.
Family history was defined as a mother or sister with ovarian
or premenopausal breast cancer. Women who reported post-
menopausal hormone use were classified as hormone therapy
(HT) users and type(s) of HT was recorded. Participants

completed a food-frequency questionnaire? from which
grams of alcohol consumed per day were estimated.

Statistical Methods

Unconditional logistic regression was used to model the
OR and 95% CI adjusted first for matching factors (age, study
center, and phase) and then fully by potential confounders.
Likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without
interaction terms were used to test for effect modification.
Tests for trend were based on the Wald statistic using con-
tinuous variables weighted by category midpoints with zero
assigned as the exposure for nonusers. Polytomous logis-
tic regression was used to simultaneously estimate separate
ORs and 95% Cls for genital talc use by histologic subtypes.
Likelihood-ratio tests were used to calculate P values for
heterogeneity by comparing polytomous logistic regression
models in which the talc association was held constant over
case subgroups to models that allowed the association to dif-
fer between case subgroups.”* Analyses were performed using
SAS v9.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and polytomous logistic
regression analyses were performed in Stata (StataCorp LP,
College Station, TX). Sensitivity analyses to assess the influ-
ence of exposure misclassification were performed with Excel
using quantitative analysis methods described previously.”*

Ethical Approval
Institutional review boards approved the study. All par-
ticipants provided written informed consent.

RESULTS

Genital use of talc, either alone or in combination with
body use, was associated with elevated epithelial ovarian
cancer risk (Table 1). Among women with no personal use,
there was no increased risk with potential exposure from dia-
phragms, condoms, or partner use. Therefore, only those with
personal genital talc exposure were classified as ever-users.
Genital talc use was associated with an OR (95% CI) of 1.33
(1.16, 1.52) adjusted only for age, study center, and phase.
Most women reported using Johnson & Johnson’s Baby Pow-
der or Shower to Shower. Fourteen women who reported
exclusive use of a cornstarch-based powder were considered
unexposed. The average age women began using tale was 20.0
for cases and 19.8 for controls. Almost half of users were cur-
rently using or had only recently discontinued powder use at
the reference date. Risk decreased with increased time since
last use. The trend for frequency of use was significant, but
the trend for years used was flat. Some subjects reported they
used talc only seasonally, but our original questionnaire did
not capture this detail. A question to capture months-per-year-
used was added in 1998 and was available for 54% of cases
and 56% of controls. Year-round use was the most common
pattern, and more cases than controls used powder year-round.
ORs for talc-years among those who reported months-per-
year-used are shown as the next-to-final entry in Table 1. An
OR of 1.49 (95% CI = 1.06, 2.10) was associated with more

association was significantly greater for women who were
African American, had no personal history of breast cancer,
had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy, were premenopausal, or
were postmenopausal and used HT. The latter finding, together
with the dose-response data, is illustrated in Figure 2. Among
the HT users, 92% used estrogen (alone or in combination),
2% used progesterone alone, and 5% used creams or supposi-

use was found in both women who had used estrogen alone or
estrogen plus progesterone. Too few women used progesterone
only HT or estrogen creams or suppositories to examine risk
with talc use in these groups (data not shown). The median
duration of HT use was 5 years. Subjects with <5 years of HT
use had an overall OR (95% CI) for EOC risk with ever-use
of talc on genitals of 2.93 (1.86, 4.62). Subjects with 25 years
of HT use had an OR (95% CI) that was slightly lower, 1.73

(1.15, 2.62), but a clearer trend for increasing risk with talc-
years was more apparent in the longer term HT users (data not
shown). To explore the potential interaction between talc use
and hysterectomy or tubal ligation, we restricted this analysis
to subjects who had either or both procedures (Table 3). For
premenopausal women, risk for EOC was increased in women
who used talc before the procedure, while risk was elevated
for use both before and after the procedure in postmenopausal
women who used HT. No associations were seen in postmeno-
pausal women who had not used HT. There were too few
subjects who had used talc only after a hysterectomy or tubal
ligation to permit reliable estimates of risk.

Returning to Table 2, we applied the convention that a
variable may be a confounder if adjustment yields a 10% dif-
ference compared with the crude OR (or, in our study, com-
pared with the OR of 1.33 adjusted for age, study center, and
study phase). A 10% lower or greater change corresponds to
an OR <1.20 or 21.46. As seen in the far right column, the
OR of 1.33 for ovarian cancer risk was not materially changed
after adjustment for any individual or all variables.

Because Figure 2 suggests that EOC risk with talc varies
by menopausal status, we revisited the issue of interaction in
eTable | (http://links.lww.com/EDE/B2) in which subjects are
stratified by menopausal status. Although few significant inter-
actions were seen, categories for several variables revealed
contrasting overall associations and/or clearer dose—responses
(Fig. 3). For premenopausal women, these included women
with a BMI > 25, those who had breastfed, those who were not
current smokers, and those who consumed more than 2.32 g
of alcohol per day. In addition, the association was stronger

for both pre- and post-menopausal women who were least
likely to have a genetic basis for their ovarian cancer, defined
as women with no personal history of breast cancer, without a
primary relative with either ovarian cancer or premenopausal
breast cancer, and non-Jewish women (eTable 1; http://links.
lww.com/EDE/B2). No important interactions were observed
for postmenopausal women, except for weight and BMI, HT
use, and the combined “genetic” variable.

Table 4 shows ORs stratified by menopausal status
and histologic subtype of epithelial ovarian cancer. Overall,
talc use increased risk for serous and endometrioid invasive
and serous borderline tumors with the dose-response most
apparent for serous invasive cancer. For premenopausal
women, both the overall associations and dose—responses
were stronger with serous invasive and serous borderline
tumors. Premenopausal women also had an increased risk
for mucinous borderline tumors at the highest quartile of
talc use OR = 2.28 (1.23, 4.26) and a dose-response. For
postmenopausal women, dose—responses were strongest for
women with invasive serous and endometrioid tumors. Talc
use was not associated with clear cell or mucinous invasive
epithelial ovarian cancer regardless of menopausal status.
The ORs and dose-responses for the combined histologic
subtypes relevant to pre- and post-menopausal women are
shown in Table 5. Except for a few categories, these were not
materially different than those illustrated in Figure 2. How-
ever, notably, premenopausal women and postmenopausal
HT-users with the relevant subtypes who had accumulated
>24 talc-years had ORs (95% CI) of 2.33 (1.32, 4.12) and
2.57 (1.51, 4.36), respectively.

DISCUSSION

We analyzed case-control data collected over 16 years
on talc use and epithelial ovarian cancer risk to address issues
related to definition of the exposure, bias and confound-
ing, effect modification, histologic heterogeneity, and dose—
response. Talc used regularly in the genital area was associated
with a 33% increase in ovarian cancer risk overall while no
apparent risk was associated with talc used only in nongenital
areas. Our results are consistent with a recent pooled analysis
from the OCAC which reported that use of powder on genitals

is associated with a 24% increased risk and no effect of non-
genital use of talc.!? There was general agreement on risk by
histologic type of epithelial ovarian cancer except that OCAC
found an association with clear cell cancer and we did not. The
findings from OCAC and our study contrast with null results
from the WHI cohort analysis'’ raising the issue of recall bias
in case—control studies.

Addressing recall bias, we conducted a sensitivity anal-
ysis that assumed truly nonexposed cases and controls were
accurately classified as unexposed (i.e., specificity 99%) and

truly exposed cases were also correctly classified (sensitivity
99%). The OR of 1.33 in our study would be nullified if the
sensitivity of correctly classified controls fell to 82% or 18%
misclassification. Unfortunately, there are no external records
to validate talc use reported by study participants to assess
whether this degree of misclassification is reasonable. Some-
what analogous to talc and ovarian cancer is alcohol use and
breast cancer. Nurses’ Health Study investigators examined
the latter association both with prospective data collected at
baseline and retrospective data obtained by resurveying sub-
jects after diagnosis.?> They found an (age adjusted) OR for
breast cancer of 1.42 associated with 30 or more grams of
alcohol/day relative to nondrinkers from the prospective data
compared with 1.33 from the retrospective data. This change
between two analyses would occur if the sensitivity of con-
trols correctly recalling alcohol use dropped to 91% (or 9%
misclassification). This suggests some degree of misclas-
sification in retrospective data but not as great as the 18%
required to nullify the association between use of talc on
genitals and ovarian cancer risk in our study. No comparable
study on tale comparing results from prospective versus ret-
rospective data has been performed. However, several obser-
vations are incompatible with the possibility that recall bias
explains the association: (1) ORs are generally lower in stud-
ies which asked about “ever use” of talc>*!! compared with
those that specified regular use,°”*'2!> whereas higher ORs
would be expected if cases are more likely to recall limited
ever-use; (2) no association with nongenital talc use; (3) risk
varies by histologic type; (4) the association is stronger in pre-
menopausal women who are closer in time to talc use and less
likely to have forgotten it; and (5) ORs from recent studies!!:3
are lower than those from earlier ones,°’ whereas increasing
publicity about the association over time might lead to greater
recall bias and higher ORs in more recent studies. Related

arguments that cases initiate talc use because of treatment of
ovarian cancer or early symptoms of disease also lack merit
because we censored exposures | year before the date of diag-
nosis and most talc-users began the habit around age 20—a
decade or more before the ovarian cancer diagnosis.

Whether the association is a result of confounding must
also be addressed. A 1998 article identified BMI, smoking,
and alcohol use as potential correlates of talc use in the gen-
eral population.” In our study, powder users were more likely
to be older, from more urban/suburban areas, heavier, asthma
sufferers, and regular analgesics users. However, none of these
or other Table 2 variables altered the overall association by
more than 10%, providing no indication of confounding. Talc
use was also greater in African Americans and notably associ-
ated with a high, albeit imprecise, OR (and 95% Cl) of 5.08
(1.32, 19.6). This finding clearly requires further study.

The observation that talc users, both case and control
subjects, were more likely to say they had asthma has not been
previously reported. The link between powder use and asthma
may not be fully appreciated from Table 2 since women who
used talc as a body powder but not to the genital area were
classified as nonexposed. Making no body or genital exposure
the nonexposed referent group and asthma the outcome, the
ORs (and 95% CI) for asthma for body exposure to talc is
1.27 (0.80, 2.03) for cases and 1.02 (0.66, 1.57) for controls.
The comparable OR for genital use of tale with or without
body use is 1.48 (1.00, 2.18) for cases and 1.45 (1.00, 2.10)
for controls. Sixty of 85 cases (70%) with asthma and 57 of 89
(64%) controls reported that talc use predated asthma onset.
Although chance must be considered a possible explanation
for this novel finding, talc is a cause of occupational asthma?’
and respiratory distress has been reported in infants after
talc was accidentally inhaled.** That asthma may be associ-
ated with use of talc is important not only because of health

consequences on its own but also because it may shed light on
biologic mechanisms potentially relevant to the talc and ovar-
ian cancer association.

Although we found no evidence of confounding, we did
find several examples of effect modification of the associa-
tion between talc and epithelial ovarian cancer. Overall, the
association was greater in women with no personal history of
breast cancer, those who had a tubal ligation or hysterectomy,
in premenopausal women, and postmenopausal women who
had used HT. Among these factors, perhaps the most impor-
tant is effect modification of the association by menopausal
status and menopausal HT.

Apparent lack of an elevated risk for epithelial ovar-
ian cancer from talc use in postmenopausal women without
HT use has not been reported previously. Explanations might
include that there is no association with talc use in the absence
of endogenous or exogenous estrogen, fading memory of past
exposures, women who will develop ovarian cancer from
talc use leave the at risk pool before they reach menopause,
or more complex interactions with multiple risk factors and
gene-environment interactions. Of possible relevance, Moor-
man et al.”? observed that reproductive events that clearly
affect risk in premenopausal women may not affect risk to the
same degree in postmenopausal women. Whatever the expla-
nation, our observation challenges the relevance of the WHI
study to the ovarian cancer/tale association since only post-
menopausal women were enrolled in WHI and HT use was
examined only as a confounder, not an effect modifier.!® Fur-
ther study will be necessary to clarify the role that talc may
play in postmenopausal women who did not use HT with a
focus on those factors that may increase endogenous estrogen,
such as greater BMI.

That the association is more apparent in premenopausal
women and in postmenopausal women who used hormonal
therapy suggests that estrogen plays a role in the association.
In talc inhalation studies conducted by the National Toxi-
cology Program, only female rats developed lung tumors.*?
Literature on airway inflammation from particulates is also
relevant. Citing evidence that asthma may be exacerbated dur-
ing pregnancy, Zhang et al.*! postulated this may be due to an
effect of estrogen on macrophage activity and inflammatory
response to particulates normally considered inert, like tita-
nium dioxide (TiO,). Their in-vivo studies demonstrated that
macrophages from pregnant mice transplanted to nonpregnant
recipients conferred an inflammatory phenotype in response
to TiO,. Such studies should be repeated with talc, another
particulate considered “inert.”

An exploratory analysis of other potential effect modi-
fiers led to several other observations that may have biologic
relevance. The overall associations and dose—responses were
“stronger” for premenopausal women who had a greater BMI,
had breastfed, were not current smokers, and consumed alco-
hol (Fig. 3). Due to the large number of associations tested,
chance must be the first explanation considered. However,

344 | www.epidem.com

a common denominator could be prolactin since its levels
are higher in women who have greater BMI,* breastfed,
do not currently smoke,*+ consume alcohol,*> and are post-
menopausal and use HT.** Like estrogen, prolactin may have
multiple effects on immune cells, especially monocytes and
macrophages*’ whose role in scavenging talc in tissue is
described.** These observations provide a framework for talc
carcinogenicity in EOC involving chronic inflammation.’

Biologic credibility of the talc/EOC association is
enhanced by persuasive evidence that inert particles the size
of talc, present in the vagina, can migrate to the upper geni-
tal tract. In a technique called hysterosalpingoscintigraphy,
technetium-labeled albumen microspheres are placed in the
vagina and their migration to the upper tract was confirme
using serial scintograms.*? The microspheres are 5 to 40 pm
in diameter—a range which includes the size of sperm an
talc. Migration from the vagina is the obvious explanation for
why talc can be found in diseased (and some normal) ova-
ries. Unfortunately, no epidemiologic study of epithelial
ovarian cancer and talc has taken the opportunity to determine
whether talc can actually be found in tissues removed at sur-
gery and correlated with exposure to talc. A clue to talc’s pres-
ence is birefringent particles found when slides are examine
under polarized-light microscopy. Although confirmation that
the material is actually talc requires scanning electron micros-
copy and X-ray dispersion spectroscopy, presence of bire-
fringence is a practical screening technique as illustrated by
a case report of a woman with ovarian cancer and long-term
talc use who had talc in her pelvic lymph nodes first suggested
by birefringence.*°

There are inherent limitations quantifying a dose—
response due to a lack of metrics for how much talc is in an
“application,” how much enters the vagina, and how much
reaches the upper genital tract where, presumably, any delete-
rious effect is mediated. This may account for the failure to
identify a dose-response in many papers on talc and ovarian
cancer. Our 1999 study’ suggested that adjusting total applica-
tions by whether the genital tract was “open” (i.e., excluding
use after a tubal ligation or hysterectomy and examining use
during times when ovulation was occurring) yielded signifi-
cant dose-responses. Mills et al.!° found a dose-response by
frequency of use. Wu et al.,!? looking at all types of body use,
found a dose-response with estimated applications. Merritt
et al.'' reported a significant trend in risk for invasive serous
ovarian cancer with years of talc use. The recent OCAC analy-
sis reported no trend with increasing lifetime applications
when restricted to talc users.'? However, an increase in risk
with increasing applications was found for nonmucinous epi-
thelial ovarian cancer when nonusers were included. Virtually
all papers that have looked at dose-response for talc and epi-
thelial ovarian cancer risk have included nonusers in the trend
analysis. In our article, we calculated talc-years and showed
that, overall, there is a significant trend for epithelial ovarian
cancer risk and talc-years when nonusers are included, and the

trend is even more apparent in premenopausal women with
certain epithelial ovarian cancer subtypes.

In summary, this study on tale and epithelial ovarian
cancer has contributed the following perspectives, some new,
regarding this association:

(1) Overall, there is an association between genital talc use
and EOC and a significant trend with increasing “talc-
years” of use.

(2) Among many epidemiologic variables, no confounders
for the association were identified.

(3) Talc users, both cases and controls, were more likely to
report a medical history of asthma.

(4) | The talc/epithelial ovarian cancer association was largely
confined to premenopausal women and postmenopausal
women who used HT. Other potential effect modifiers
in premenopausal women included BMI, breastfeeding,
current smoking, or alcohol use. These observations
may suggest a role for estrogen and/or prolactin, both
known to affect macrophage function and inflammatory
response.

(5) Histologic subtypes of epithelial ovarian cancer more
likely to be associated with talc include serous and
mucinous borderline tumors and invasive serous and
endometrioid tumors.

(6) For epithelial ovarian cancer categories based on certain
effect modifiers or histologic subtypes, stronger overall
associations and dose—responses were observed.

(7) | The association may be stronger in African Americans.

An editorial!’ accompanying the WHI study!® noted
that “several case-control studies have reported associations
between talc use and ovarian cancer risk” and “no epidemio-
logic studies have demonstrated a dose-response” (page 2).
We believe these appraisals understate the epidemiologic evi-
dence. There have been dozens of case-control studies and
several have, in fact, found a dose-response. The editorial fur-
ther notes that “it does not seem likely that additional conven-
tional epidemiologic studies will strengthen the evidence for
or against talc carcinogenicity” (page 2). We believe the obser-
vations made here present a good case for talc carcinogenicity
and that reanalyses of existing data from already published
studies might provide confirmatory evidence. To encourage
consolidation of data, we have provided a copy of the “raw”
and derived variables examined in our study to NCI dbGaP
(available here: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gap/

SAS and Stata programs used in this analysis (eAppendix 1;
