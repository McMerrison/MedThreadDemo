# MedThread Demo

## Overview

The goal of this project is to automate the process of extracting data, correlations, key features, and conclusions from a database  of research papers. Data is parsed in the form of text as well as quantative charts and tables.

The model draws conclusions from the text, and converts any numeric data into coded data structures for further analysis via machine learning.

The textual conclusions are compared with the output of the analytical model to verify results and provide key insights, as well as citations pointing to specific areas in the source material that can be used as evidence.


## Technical Overview

The model is written in Python with the following dependencies:
